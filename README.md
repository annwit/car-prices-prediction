# Car prices analysis and prediction

Data analysis (data visualisations) and machine learning models (decision trees, random forests) on the car sales dataset.\
Performed on Google Colaboratory notebooks (with the use of Python 3 and many specialistic libraries), which I linked to my GitHub account.


Project idea and dataset from one of DataWorkshop's (https://dataworkshop.eu/) course, which I finished.
